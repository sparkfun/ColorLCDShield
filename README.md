The Color LCD Shield interfaces your Arduino with a knock-off [132x132 Nokia 6100 LCD](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/569). The LCD is available with one of two controlling drivers - a [Philips PCF8833](https://dlnmh9ip6v2uc.cloudfront.net/datasheets/LCD/Color/PCF8833_1.pdf) or an Epson [S1D15G10](https://dlnmh9ip6v2uc.cloudfront.net/datasheets/LCD/Color/S1D15G10D08BE_TM_MF1493_03.pdf).

A really great resource for working with both the Epson and Philips controllers is Jim Lynch's [Display Driver tutorial](http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorial/Nokia%206100%20LCD%20Display%20Driver.pdf). Much of this example code stems from that document.
